# üìà Interactive Stock Market Analysis App

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive web application that provides predictive analytics for the stock market. Built with Python and Streamlit, it allows users to enter a stock ticker and receive several analytical outputs, including a next-day price prediction and short-term momentum analysis.

The app demonstrates a full data science pipeline, from real-time data acquisition via API to model training, prediction, and presentation in a user-friendly GUI.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Features

* **App Framework:** Streamlit
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Key Libraries:** `yfinance`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`
* **Features:**
    * **Interactive GUI:** Users can input any stock ticker to get a custom analysis.
    * **Next-Day Prediction:** A Linear Regression model predicts the closing price for the next trading day.
    * **30-Day Forecast:** A statistical ARIMA model provides a longer-term forecast with confidence intervals.
    * **Intraday Momentum Analysis:** Calculates the 1-minute Relative Strength Index (RSI) to gauge short-term market sentiment ("overbought" or "oversold").

    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it (Windows)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate it (Mac/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the Required Packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
